        Humans had always feared the unknown lurking in the dark. <br> 
        Shunning it ensured their survival for generations. <br><br>
        Yet there are those whose curiosity must be sated. <br>
        They would pursue the endeavor even if it kills them. <br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
        The defiance that would drive them to explore the stars. <br>

    <!--ShockPoint introduction-->
    <div class="centertitle shockpoint parallax top-mask">
      <p class="mono">
        At the cusp of a technological evolution, <br>
        came the invention of a device called the ShockPoint Drive. <br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="centertitle shockpoint parallax bottom-mask">
      <p class="mono">
        The catalyst for travelling at speeds faster than light. <br>
        The answer to the greatest question, now within their reach. <br>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
       However, the expedition was a disappointment. <br>
       For there were absolutely no other living organisms. <br><br>
       A galaxy that's nothing more than an empty promise. <br>
       The discovered habitable worlds, strangely barren. <br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
        The wanderlust inevitably lost its novelty. <br>
        They have been neglected, abandoned, utterly alone. <br><br>

         It's replaced by restlessness, questioning their purpose. <br>
          Why did their cruel gods create them in the first place? <br>

       As Isaac Clarke was ruminating about his death, <br>
       the excruciating pain that's demanding to be felt. <br><br>
       A thought that even a sturdy metallic shuttle shudders.  <br>
       Subjected to the unforgiving universeâ€¦ <br>
