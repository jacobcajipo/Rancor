    <!-- Prologue -->

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
It's only natural for us to fear whatever's lurking in the dark.
After all, we are creatures that constantly crave certainty.
Not knowing what lies ahead triggers a primal need to escape from it.
Somewhere filled with other people, we know we can be safe.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
Yet some were born and bred differently among the pack.
Whose curiosities far outweigh the need for the comfort of familiarity.
Willing to go against their instinct to run and face the unknown.
These acts of defiance pushed humanity towards great distances.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
The defiance that would drive them to explore even the farthest stars.      </p>
    </div>

    <!--ShockPoint introduction-->
    <div class="centertitle shockpoint parallax top-mask">
      <p class="mono">
Since ancient times, people have traveled by various modes of transportation.
An accurate indicator of how far we have made progress in technology.
More specifically, how much faster can we get from one point to another?
Enter the creation of a device that changed the world–
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="centertitle shockpoint parallax bottom-mask">
      <p class="mono">
The ShockPoint Drive.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
An invention by an astrophysicist of Japanese descent, circa 2300.
It completely reinforced how the spacetime continuum functions.
Forgoing the idea of pushing the engines to their limits to reach lightspeed.
Focusing instead on poking a hole in the fabric of space using nuclear energy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
The ShockPoint Drive became the catalyst for interstellar travel.
Igniting the race for mankind's search for life on other planets.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
Governments and private corporations flocked to the start of a new era.
The idea of exploring new worlds was too good to pass up.
With Earth bordering the state of being uninhabitable, it was necessary.
It's the second wind everybody needs. An excuse to hope and to start again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p class="mono">
A hundred years of extensive study of the cosmos went by.
New entries were added to the periodic table of elements.
Biomes thought to be impossible to exist were made known.
The library of knowledge kept expanding, with a singular irony.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="mono">
All the planets deemed suitable for life were strangely–
 <br> <br>
Lifeless.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="mono">
This phenomenon gave birth to revised philosophies and religions.
Although it is more or less just a distorted version of older beliefs.
Catering to those who can no longer be convinced of a man in the sky.
But looking to justify their existence in this meaningless universe.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="parallax centertitle" style="background-color: grey;">
      <p class="mono">
        One even went as far as to say that death is their ultimate calling.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="mono">
A man named Isaac Clarke was never fond of the said worship.
Fearing death just as much as he's afraid of being left in the dark.
Clinging to life and to the only person he holds dearly.
He feels as if he will never be whole without her.

But can his fragile mind and body endure the horrors of reality?
