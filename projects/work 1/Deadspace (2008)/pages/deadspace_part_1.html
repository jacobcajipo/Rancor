    Mankind had always been afraid of the dark,<br>
  be it the unknown, the void, the abyss, the shadows.<br>
  Steering away had ensured their survival for millennia,<br>
  But some are drawn into it, piqued by their curiosity.<br>
  </p>

    This fear is also what drove them to explore the stars.

  <div class="half">

    Yet all they found was disappointment.<br>
  For there was nothing out there. Not one.<br>
  The galaxies were emptier than they look.<br>
  Trillions of stars with barren lifeless planets.

  <div class="half">

    The once feared unknown quickly lost its novelty,<br>

    As Isaac Clarke was ruminating about his own death,<br>

    With eyes closed, Isaac managed to block out the noise.<br>
  There was a constant screeching of metal against metal,<br>

  <div class="half">
