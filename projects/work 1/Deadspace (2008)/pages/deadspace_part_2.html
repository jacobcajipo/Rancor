    Welcome CEC employee, 
    to the USG Ishimura.
    The Ishimura was the first Planet Cracker-class vessel 
    and is now the oldest serving,
    with sixty-two years of continuous service.
    It holds the record for highest number of planet cracks,
    with thirty-four to date
    and highest dead weight of refined product
    at fourteen trillion kilotons and counting. 
    Whether you'll be joining us aboard the Ishimura 
    or strengthening the extraction work force on the colony, 
    the captain and crew would like to welcome you 
    and we hope your stay is a pleasant one.
